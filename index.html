				<h5 class="header">Hosting: GitHub Pages</h5>
				<p>I used GitHub Pages to host my page. To do this, I roughly followed the steps found at https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart
				 first I created a new repository. Next, under the Pages tab in Settings, I selected main as the branch to build my GitHub page from.
				 I created an index.html file and after a little bit of time, the link to the webpage appeared under the Pages tab in Settings.

				<h5 class="header">Framework: Materialize CSS</h5>
				<p>I chose to use the Materialize CSS framework. I copied their cdn link found on their getting started page.
				I explored the different features they showcased on their website and selected which ones I wanted to have on my page.
				For a lot of their examples, they also showed the code. However for some of the features, I had to inspect the page to see what code to use.

			<h5 class="header">Challenges</h5>
			<p>One of the difficulties I encountered was that GitHub Pages takes some time to update. I initialy editted my html file directly on the Github UI (which already feels kind of wrong to do).
			There is a delay of a few minutes after changes are made before they are reflected on the GitHub Page. I really value having near-instantaneous feedback when making webpages, so I decided to rectify this.
			To get around this issue, I just made a new html file on the moons then copied and pasted my existing code. It was very quick and easy to continue where I left off. This was because I didn't have other files to include yet.
			Once I was satisfied with my webpage, I copied my code back to GitHub. If I didn't have the moons to host my page while I worked, I would have probably found some way to do local development.
